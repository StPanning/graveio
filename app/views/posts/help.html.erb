<h3>Command line interface</h3>
<ul>
  For easier posting of content to graveio, you can use bury, a Ruby command line
  tool which also integrates with Vim.
  <br \>
  Enable bury with Vim by adding the following line to your .vimrc:
  <pre class="help">map &lt;F2&gt; :w !bury -t %&lt;CR&gt;</pre>
  The default host and port for the tool can be configured via a rc file
  located at "~/.buryrc"
  <br \>
  An example configuration of using bury with graveio:
  <pre class="help">
default:
  :host: <%= @server_ip %>
  :port: <%= @server_port%></pre>

  <li><b>Get bury here:</b></li>
  <span>
    <i class="icon-download"></i> <%= link_to "bury.rb", "bin/bury.rb" %>
  </span>
</ul>
